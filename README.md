# ADA-Payments-for-Joomla-3-and-4
Create a Payment Plugin, Module &amp; Component for Joomla 3 and 4 for 11 popular shopping carts that connects to a COTI Wallet.
We have found that people building on Joomla tend to be more commercially minded than those that use other shopping carts. This is why we have speciaised in using Joomla for the last 20 years.

There are about 1,500,000 installations of Joomla around the world, installations cover most of the languages required to penetrate the international market.

DEMOGRAPHIC

We will target Joomla developers serving both online and in person businesses.

ACTION PLAN

We have already put to gether the basic PHP files and folder structure, step two will be to edit this standardised structure for each of the shopping carts below and incorporate the COTI API's.

We will list all of our components, modules and plugins on the Joomla Extensions Directory: https://extensions.joomla.org/

We will promote the use of ADA in online and in person retail sales.

Use cases:

Applications will be required for these main financial transactions carried out on websites:

Online Retail Sales

The core objective is to enable simple and efficient online payments with reporting back to the shop owner in the back end.

Donations

The ability to accept one-time payments, these may be carried out by offering simple buttons or as part of the checkout procedure.

Subscriptions

Subscriptions would be used for membership sites, software as a service or maybe recurring donations.

Retail In-Person Point-of-Sale

As part of this proposal, we would start the research and preparation of plans to launch a viable payment processing method that could be used by retailers for in person payments to compliment online sales using QR Codes.

We also envisage the acceptance of multiple Cardano Native Tokens, particularly if there are country specific tokens launched on the exchanges.
